Getting started with the second assignment:
Download PS2/BDD-PS2.ipynb to get started with the first assignment. If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, please work through a tutorial or two (such as this one) before you get started on this assignment. If you're new to git/GitHub, don't worry, you don't need to do anything fancy for this problem set. Just click on "Clone or Download" and then download the entire directory as a .zip.
